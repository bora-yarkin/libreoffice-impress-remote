# LibreOffice Extension

The extension is packaged as an `.oxt` archive. It should remain as self-contained as possible.

## Rules

- Prefer Python stdlib inside the extension.
- Avoid compiled native dependencies.
- Avoid installing pip packages into LibreOffice's bundled Python.
- Use UNO APIs for Impress control.
- Keep the phone UI as static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Build

```bash
python tools/build_oxt.py
```

## Install

```text
LibreOffice -> Tools -> Extensions -> Add
```
